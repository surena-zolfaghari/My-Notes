Lecture 23 
Doppler effect

Audience is fix and source of sound is moving. This statement in electromagnetic is meaningless. 

$$f' = f(1+\dfrac {v}{c} \cos\theta) \tag{1}$$

Now when we deal with sound, there is something mechanically oscillating. something vibrating. With electromagnetic radiation charges are vibrating with a certain frequency (or certain period because $T=1/f$). How far does electromagnetic radiation in the time of one period? 
$$\lambda = cT=\dfrac {c}{f}$$
We call it wave length of electromagnetic radiation. In the optical astronomy we can not measure the period or the frequency of optical light, all we can measure is the wavelength.


$$\lambda' = \lambda(1-\dfrac {v}{c} \cos\theta) \tag{2}$$
you can derive $(2)$ from $(1)$ and then you have to use Taylor expansion for  $v << c$  and then you would have the equation $(2)$ simply. 15:12

## Lecture 1
The colors of the rainbow in the sky are these because of electricity. 
Also see experiment of Vandegraph

## Lecture 2
Does a charge move tangential  on field line necessarily ? In general no.

Why does the electric field of dipole vanish faster than a singular charge?


## Lecture 4
Electrostatic potential energy U: The work that is needed I do to form a distribution charge is called electrostatic potential energy. In other word, the work that is needed that I should carry a charge from infinity to position P. 
$$W_{me} = \int_{\infty}^R \vec{dr}. \vec{F}_{me} = \int_{R}^\infty \vec{dr}. \vec{F}_{el} = U$$

Electric potential V:  The work per unit of charge that I should carry an unit charge from infinity to position P. 
$$V = U/q$$
$$V_A = \int_A ^\infty \vec{dr}. \vec{E}$$

## Lecture 5
We want to discus about connection between electric potential and electric fields

Faraday's cage can block electromagnetic wave. Also electric field.




# Deep Learning
## Week 1


Rectified linear unit (ReLU):
Rectify just means taking a max of 0 which is why you get a function shape like this.


### Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

convolutional networks are often used for image data.


Convolutional Neural Network  ---> 
Recurrent Neural Network  
just talked about methods of supervised learning.

### Why is Deep Learning taking off?
